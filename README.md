HELLO, WORLD!

User Stories:
As a user I want to log in/log out. (OAUTH?)
As a user I have a dashboard that displays selected widgets.
As a user I can later add/remove widgets to my dashboard.
As a user I edit my widget's specifications.

Widgets I'd like to choose from include:
-Weather widget.
-News widget.
-Transit time widget.
-Soundcloud widget.
-Simple game widget.
-Email notification widget.
-Todo list widget.
-Facebook & Twitter notification widgets.
-Alarm widget (potentially with Twillio and game-element Integration).
-ESPN widget.

Technologies to spike on:
Angular.
React(?).
The million APIs we're going to be using for our widgets.

Things that are sexy:
Drag and Drop.
SPA (single page app).
Animations.

Stretch functionality:
Chrome Extension.
Chatroom between users. (Through FB messenger?)
